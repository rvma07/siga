jQuery Accordion
================

This is a customisable accordion widget for jQuery.

It gets around the [well documented jQuery animation jump issue of slideDown()](http://jqueryfordesigners.com/slidedown-animation-jump-revisited/) by avoiding slideDown() and slideUp() altogether. Hopefully this will allow me to incorporate some nice opener effects at a later date.
